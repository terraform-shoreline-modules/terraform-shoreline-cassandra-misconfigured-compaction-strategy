### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Misconfigured Compaction Strategy.
---

Misconfigured compaction strategy is an incident type that occurs when the way data is compacted within a database cluster is not properly configured. This can lead to excessive compaction activity that can negatively impact the cluster's performance and stability. The incident can cause slow query response times, increased disk usage, and high CPU utilization, among other issues. It is crucial to identify and fix the misconfiguration promptly to ensure the cluster's smooth operation.

### Parameters
```shell
export CASSANDRA_HOST="PLACEHOLDER"

export KEYSPACE="PLACEHOLDER"

export TABLE="PLACEHOLDER"

export DEVICE="PLACEHOLDER"

export PID="PLACEHOLDER"

```

## Debug

### 1. Check compaction status
```shell
nodetool compactionstats
```

### 2. Check compaction settings
```shell
nodetool describeconf compaction
```

### 8. Check if there are any Java exceptions related to compaction
```shell
grep -i "compaction" /var/log/cassandra/system.log | grep -i "exception"
```

### 4. Check if there are any compaction errors in the system log
```shell
grep "Compaction" /var/log/system.log
```

### 5. Check if there are any disk space issues
```shell
df -h
```

### 6. Check if there are any network issues
```shell
ping ${HOSTNAME}

traceroute ${HOSTNAME}
```

### 7. Check if there are any hardware issues
```shell
dmesg | grep -i error
```

### 3. Check if compaction is causing high CPU usage
```shell
top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)" | sed "s/.*, *\([0-9.]*\)%* id.*/\1/" | awk '{print 100 - $1"% CPU usage"}'
```

### 9. Check if there are any other processes competing for resources
```shell
ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd,%mem,%cpu --sort=-%mem | head
```

### 10. Check if there are any compaction-related metrics exceeding the threshold
```shell
nodetool tablehistograms ${KEYSPACE}.${TABLE}
```

### 11. Check if there are any pending compactions
```shell
nodetool compactionstats -H | grep pending
```

### 12. Check if there are any tombstones causing excessive compaction
```shell
nodetool cfstats ${KEYSPACE}.${TABLE} | grep "Number of Tombstones"
```

### 13. Check if there are any disk I/O issues
```shell
iostat -xm 5 3 | grep ${DEVICE}
```

### 14. Check if there are any compaction-related threads stuck
```shell
jstack ${PID} | grep "CompactionExecutor" -A 20
```

### 15. Check if there are any file descriptor limits reached
```shell
ulimit -n

cat /proc/${PID}/limits | grep "Max open files"
```

### 16. Check if there are any memory usage issues
```shell
free -m

cat /proc/meminfo | grep MemAvailable
```

## Repair

### Identify and analyze the configuration settings of the compaction strategy and rectify the misconfiguration.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set the variables

COMPACT_STRATEGY=${COMPACTION_STRATEGY}   # Replace with the name of the compaction strategy

CONFIG_FILE=${CONFIG_FILE_PATH}          # Replace with the path of the configuration file



# Identify and analyze the configuration settings

if grep -q "$COMPACT_STRATEGY" "$CONFIG_FILE"

then

  # Rectify the misconfiguration

  sed -i "s/$COMPACT_STRATEGY/${CORRECTED_VALUE}/" "$CONFIG_FILE"

  echo "Misconfiguration in $COMPACT_STRATEGY has been rectified."

else

  echo "$COMPACT_STRATEGY is already configured correctly."

fi



exit 0
